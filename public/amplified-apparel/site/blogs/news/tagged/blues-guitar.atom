<p>August 27, 1990 was a tragic day for the world of music; the day that Stevie Ray Vaughan boarded a helicopter that would never make it out of Alpine Valley in East Troy, WI. The helicopter crashed into a hill in dense fog around midnight following a concert. SRV, 3 of Eric Clapton's entourage, and the pilot, were all killed. I can only wonder and imagine what Stevie would be up to these days if he were still around.</p>
<p>I didn't know who Stevie was until I was around 20 years old, but he changed everything for me. Here's a little of the story about how I discovered him, as I told it on Instagram last year on what would have been his 62nd birthday.</p>
<p><span>"The first time that I heard one of Stevie's songs was while I was working at Chili's, circa 1997. "Pride and Joy" was one of the songs on one of our compilation CD's that played throughout the restaurant. I still remember right where I was, bussing a table, when it came on. I had never listened to the blues or anything directly influenced by it before. I was very much into 90's rock at the time. But that song changed everything; I was hooked. Thank you, Stevie, for opening up my world."</span></p>
<p><span>I'll definitely be listening to some Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble in honor of SRV. If you haven't discovered his music yet, I highly recommend that you do so immediately.Â </span></p>
<p><span>P.S. I couldn't find the actual video footage of the video above, but it's really worth a watch. It's "Leave My Little Girl Alone" from the 1989 Austin City Limits show. Enjoy!</span></p>]]>
