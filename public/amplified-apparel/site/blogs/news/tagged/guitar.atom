      <![CDATA[<p>Leggings are the hottest fashion trend right now and we're making them even hotter by adding guitars to them. We've added our first design to the store to make sure that our customers have what they need to fill out their rockin' wardrobe.</p>
<p>We didn't want to add just any leggings to the store so we considered our options very carefully. Here are some of the reasons that we chose this particular product.</p>
<p><span>Product Features</span></p>
<ul>
<li>82% polyester/18% spandex fabric blend</li>
<li>Four-way (horizontal and vertical) stretch</li>
<li>Comfortable and smooth microfiber yarn</li>
<li>Elastic waistband</li>
<li>White fabric lining (avoid embarrassing bend-over moments)</li>
<li>All-over printing offers unlimited and unrestricted design possibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Our first <a href="https://amplifiedapparel.com/collections/leggings/products/cupids-guitar-leggings" title="Guitar Leggings for Women">guitar leggings</a> design features a guitar-pierced heart on a dark grey background. It's completely original, of course, so you won't have to worry about running into a friend, co-worker, or perfect stranger with the same exact design ever again... unless these get <em>really</em> popular that is. We've also added a <a href="https://amplifiedapparel.com/collections/leggings/products/cupids-guitar-kids-leggings" title="Kids Guitar Leggings">kids leggings</a> version of this design for all of the little ones in your life.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p><span>Halloween is almost here! This month's t-shirt design gets a theme for the upcoming spooky season. I cooked up tons of ideas this year for new Halloween designs, but I only have so much time to create them, so I went with my favorite.</span></p>
<p><span mce-data-marked="1">I was browsing Halloween themed images online and this design immediately jumped into my head when I saw a werewolf. I knew how I wanted him to be standing and what I wanted the scenery to look like. I really enjoyed creating the artwork for this shirt and I hope that it will help get you into the Halloween spirit.</span></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Now this is an invention that I can get behind. Even when I was playing guitar every day, all day (back when I was young and single), I probably only changed my strings like once every six months. I know, I know. But no matter how often you change them, it's a pain in the ass. You have to try to hold your guitar between your legs and position it just right. Maybe lay it on your lap and try not to drop it on the ground while pushing in the bridge pins on your acoustic. There has to be a better way, right? Well, now there is! Or at least there could be...</p>
<p>Enter the Personal Guitar Workshop; a new <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798347341/maintaining-with-ease-displaying-with-pride" target="_blank" title="The Personal Guitar Workshop Kickstarter Campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter campaign</a> by founder/inventor Dave Sommerfield. The idea was to create "a device that would make caring for our beloved instruments easier." I believe that it will do just that.</p>
<p>The awesome part is that it doesn't matter if you play acoustic or electric guitar, it will work for both. It also doubles (or triples?) as a guitar stand! Pretty sweet if you ask me. If you're feeling inspired and generous go check out the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798347341/maintaining-with-ease-displaying-with-pride" target="_blank" title="Support the Personal Guitar Workshop Kickstarter Campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a> and become a supporter.</p>]]>

    <title>Steve Vai on Allan Holdsworth</title>
    <author>
      <name>Jeff Garris</name>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span>Steve Vai and I don't have a whole lot in common. He's a <em>way </em>better guitarist then me and he has a much cooler look then me. The one thing that we do have in common, though, is that we have a hard time calling anyone the greatest guitarist of all time.</span></p>
<p>Stevie Ray Vaughan is definitely my favorite, but I wouldn't be so bold as to call him the best of all time. While Steve Vai was listing out some of the greats in his interview with <a href="http://www.musicradar.com/news/steve-vai-these-are-the-guitarists-that-blew-my-mind" target="_blank" title="Steve Vai: these are the 10 guitarists that blew my mind" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Radar</a>, he did propose that Allan Holdsworth could possibly hold that coveted title in his mind. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<p>"I very rarely agree with the term best guitar player. It just seems so obscene to put something so subjective into a best category.</p>
<p>"But if I had to say there was one, I would pick Allan Holdsworth.</p>
<p>"He was unique in ways that I don't think have been discovered yet. Many musicians can be considered ahead of their time, but usually - they're not. They're mainly ahead of everyone else at that time.</p>
<p>"For example, Jimi Hendrix wasn't ahead of his time; he was perfect for his time and ahead of everyone else.</p>
<p>"Allan Holdsworth was definitely ahead of his time because it's hard to realize how great he is - not many people actually understand. It takes time for us to catch up with those that are ahead of their time.</p>
<p>"I would not be surprised if in 100 years from now, if people are still even listening to guitar - which I suspect they will be - he'll be singled out as 'the one' alone, so to speak.</p>
<p>"The way he uses the whole tone scale is like his own baby shoes - it's so easy for him. His thought process was phenomenal.</p>
<p>"I can hear any guitar player and I know what they're doing - I might not be able to play it - but I can see it in my mind's eye.</p>
<p>"But I do not know what the fuck Holdsworth was doing at all..."</p>
<p>I honestly had never heard of Holdsworth, but you can bet that I looked him up immediately. I don't really even know how to describe what I found. It's this sort of jazz fusion madness and there's something in his playing that I can't explain; it's mesmerizing and a bit confusing. The guy is all over the fretboard, manipulating notes that I had no idea even belonged together. I don't know if he's the greatest guitarist of all time, but he's got to be up there.</p>
<p>Sadly, in my research I also found that he passed away not long ago on April 15, 2017. Have a listen and help keep <a href="https://youtu.be/TYiVWl9l804?t=2m" target="_blank" title="Allan Holdsworth Trio 2010-11-09 Leverkusen, GR" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allan Holdsworth's music</a> alive.</p>]]>
