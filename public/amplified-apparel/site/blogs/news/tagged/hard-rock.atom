      <![CDATA[<p><span>Halloween is almost here! This month's t-shirt design gets a theme for the upcoming spooky season. I cooked up tons of ideas this year for new Halloween designs, but I only have so much time to create them, so I went with my favorite.</span></p>
<p><span mce-data-marked="1">I was browsing Halloween themed images online and this design immediately jumped into my head when I saw a werewolf. I knew how I wanted him to be standing and what I wanted the scenery to look like. I really enjoyed creating the artwork for this shirt and I hope that it will help get you into the Halloween spirit.</span></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>More guitar t-shirts are coming! This month is the start of something new for Amplified Apparel. I'm going to be kicking out a new design every month. Why? Because you need more guitar t-shirts and I'm going to make sure that you get them! I know, I know, I'm the best.</p>
<p>OK, so it's not all about you. I really enjoy coming up with new design ideas, fleshing them out, and then creating the final product for you to enjoy. In this case I was actually working on a different, yet related, design when I came up with this <a href="https://amplifiedapparel.com/products/no-soft-rock-t-shirt" title="No Soft Rock Guitar T-Shirt">guitar t-shirt</a>. It's funny how that happens sometimes. The point is that I create these shirts with joy and I hope that you'll wear them with the same passion.</p>]]>
